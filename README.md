# Repository-Manager
Create a way for me to make lists of random repositoryes and a section for my own repos. This will help me replace the system I have now where I star all my projects and you the star list thing to order them.

Simple one page app.\
Github auth login\
Local sotrage to save info.\
Have multiple sections hotdog style that you can drag repos into. Propabably with the drag and drop api.\
Like project except with repos.\
You can also accses setting on the top rioght which opens up a popup menu.\
You can have a big search bar up top. This has a debounce timer probabaly lie Josh's\
You can add an item to many "folder" long johns.\
You can filter through each infividual folder with a search within which can come out through a ... on the top right of the folder. Just liek project in github.\
You can also like spotify right click and choose all the folder it's going to be in but checkmark style unlike spotify.\
